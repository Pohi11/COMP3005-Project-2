# COMP3005 Project 2
 COMP3005 Project 2

Installation:
This program is made in python so you must first have python installed.

Then you must install the library used by running this command in your command prompt
pip install psycopg2

The json library must also be installed, I'm not sure if it is already installed but if not run this command in the command prompt
pip install json

Then you must edit the code to ensure that the get_db_connection() function has the right information for your database, incase your password is different or something

once the library is installed you can run the program and follow the menu in the console
